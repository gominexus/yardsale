This is a simple implementation of the yard sale model of income distribution / inequality, originally created by Anirban Chakraborti. The model is based on the helpful description provided here: https://www.physics.umd.edu/hep/drew/math_general/yard_sale.html (the model itself originating from econophysicist Anirban Chakraborti in 2002).

Rather than focus on the distribution in income generated by yard sale transactions, the idea of this model is to visualise evolution in wealth held by each trader. As a defaut there are 100 traders, each of whom are represented by a circle. The circles then vary in area over time in promoportin to wealth. Individual transactions are highighted with a line between the two traders involved. Visualisation uses the cross-platform Python multimedia library Pyglet.
